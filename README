Creating a MSP430 cross-compile toolchain on Gentoo
-----------------------------------------------------

1. Add this overlay to your Gentoo system.

2. Install sys-devel/crossdev from this overlay which includes proper msp430
support.

3. Use the command `sudo crossdev msp430' to create a standard MSP430
toolchain. Note that you can also specify a specific version for gcc (currently
both 4.3.4 and 4.4.3 are in the overlay) and if you want gdb support installed
for the MSP430 you should run `sudo crossdev --ex-gdb msp430' instead.

4. Once crossdev successfully creates a toolchain you should symlink the
ldscripts folder into a place where the linker will find it. If you don't do
this you may run into problems discussed in Gentoo bug #147155, especially if
you're using flags specifying specific instruction sets. Running the command
`sudo ln -s /usr/$CHOST/msp430/lib/ldscripts /usr/msp430/lib/ldscripts' where
$CHOST is something like x86_64-pc-linux-gnu or i686-pc-linux-gnu for standard
amd64 or x86 architectures running Gentoo.
